# Notes Repository
A collection of various notes I've made on different learning paths.

In every notebook I mention the sources from which I studied to make these notebooks and encourage anyone reading to take a look into them, since I could have made mistakes while writing. All of the sources are free and were found by either googling or word of mounth. Some are youtube videos, some are free courses, some are documentation found online.

I do not own or have written any of those sources. I am thankful though for having found them and for having the time to go through them and make "cheatsheats" of my own. Most of those notebooks are here to have a centralized list of topics and examples for myself, but anyone is free to read through and use them as long as they credit the orignial sources as I did.

# Contents
 * **python_notes** are the notebooks I used to write down the topics I was unfamiliar with in Python. Most topics do not have any particular order and were just mixed together whenever I came across them.
 * **applied_data_science_python** are notes from a course on data science I took from IBM which can be found at: https://cognitiveclass.ai/learn/data-science-with-python.
 
 # Final Considerations
 
This last section is dedicated to all the authors, content creators and whoever else is mixed up in the bunch of sources I have collected during my studies. Without your noble quest to make knowledge free for everyone, you would not have made such a significant impact on my studies and carreer, and for that all of you should pe proud of. As for me, I am just thankful. And to anyone who decides to read my notes, may you have as much success as I did. I'll be updating this repository as I dive deeper into the world of programming, data science and whatever else crosses my path.
